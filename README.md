# Quiet Send 🤝

A thoughtful Chrome extension for sharing links with the people who matter most.

## What is Quiet Send?

In our noisy digital world, sometimes the most meaningful connections happen quietly. Quiet Send lets you save interesting links throughout the week and share them thoughtfully with your closest contacts through a gentle weekly digest.

No more overwhelming group chats or forgotten bookmarks. Just a simple, intentional way to share what matters with the people you care about.

## How it works

1. **Save links as you browse** - Click the Quiet Send icon to save any webpage with a personal note
2. **Add your inner circle** - Manage up to 5 contacts who'll receive your weekly digest
3. **Send thoughtfully** - Your saved links are bundled into a beautiful weekly email digest
4. **Stay connected** - Receive a copy yourself to remember what you've shared

## Features

- 🔖 **One-click link saving** with personal notes
- 👥 **Contact management** for your closest friends and family
- 📧 **Weekly digest emails** (backend integration coming soon)
- 💝 **Personal touch** - add your own thoughts to each link
- 🎯 **Intentional sharing** - quality over quantity
- 🔒 **Privacy-focused** - your data stays yours

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
5. The Quiet Send icon will appear in your toolbar

## Current Status

This extension is currently in development. The interface and link saving functionality are complete, but the email backend is still being built. Right now, your links and contacts are stored locally in your browser.

## Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Mindful sharing** over endless scrolling
- **Quality connections** over broadcast messaging  
- **Weekly rhythms** over constant notifications
- **Personal notes** over bare links
- **Small circles** over large audiences
